ZK-Lending Protocol

## Short Description
A zero-knowledge proof-based DeFi lending protocol that allows users to prove their collateral is sufficient without revealing the exact amount.  
This preserves user financial privacy while ensuring loan security.

## Problem Statement
Current DeFi lending protocols require users to display their collateral amount publicly on the blockchain.  
This exposes sensitive financial data and discourages many users from adopting DeFi solutions.

## Proposed Solution
- Use the **Soundness Layer** to verify a ZK proof showing that collateral ≥ loan amount.  
- A custom smart contract releases the loan only if the proof is valid.  
- Users remain anonymous while their financial privacy is preserved.

## Technical Architecture
1. User generates a ZK proof through an integrated wallet.  
2. The proof is submitted to the Soundness Layer for verification.  
3. If valid → the smart contract executes the loan release.  
4. The lender only sees a “valid proof” confirmation, not the user’s financial details.  

**Components:**
- DeFi Lending Smart Contract  
- ZK proof generator (wallet side)  
- On-chain verification through Soundness Layer  

## Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** Research & architecture + proof design  
- **Week 3–4:** Smart contract implementation (MVP)  
- **Week 5–6:** Integration with Soundness testnet  
- **Week 7–8:** Testing & public demo
