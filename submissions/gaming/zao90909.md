ZK-Quest Reward

## Short Description
A blockchain gaming reward system that uses zero-knowledge proofs to verify quest completions and prevent bot abuse.  
Players can prove they have completed a quest fairly without revealing sensitive in-game data.

## Problem Statement
Blockchain play-to-earn games often face issues with bots and multi-account farming, which reduces fairness for real players.  
Current verification systems require full disclosure of in-game data, which compromises player privacy.

## Proposed Solution
- Use ZK proofs to verify that a player has completed a quest or achieved specific in-game conditions.  
- Proof verification is handled by the **Soundness Layer**, ensuring fairness without exposing player data.  
- Rewards are distributed only when a valid ZK proof is submitted.  
- Ensures one player = one reward without revealing personal or gameplay details.  

## Technical Architecture
1. Player completes a quest in the game client.  
2. The client generates a ZK proof of completion.  
3. The proof is submitted to the Soundness Layer for verification.  
4. If valid → the game smart contract distributes the reward (tokens, NFTs, or in-game assets).  

**Components:**
- Game client with ZK proof generator.  
- Smart contract for reward distribution.  
- Soundness Layer for ZK proof verification.  

## Timeline
- **Week 1–2:** Design quest verification logic & ZK proof structure  
- **Week 3–4:** Implement smart contract reward system  
- **Week 5–6:** Integrate with Soundness testnet  
- **Week 7–8:** Testing with demo players & community showcase
